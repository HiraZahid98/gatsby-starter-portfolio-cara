# Hi, I'm Hira Zahid

I'm creating web applications for the next generation of consumer-facing companies. I am looking for more opportunities to work in coding on a freelance basis.
As a freelance web developer I collaborated with several web developers in Pakistan, at the same time maintaining clients world wide.I am currently working in Siemens between Pakistan, Germany and Italy.
