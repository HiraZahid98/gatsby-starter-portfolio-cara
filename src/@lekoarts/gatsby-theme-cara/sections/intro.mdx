# Hi, I'm Hira Zahid

I'm creating web applications for the next generation of consumer-facing companies. I love developing websites and I am looking for more opportunities to work in coding on a freelance basis.
As a freelance web developer and designer I collaborated with several web developers in Pakistan, USA 
and Nigeria, at the same time maintaining clients world wide.
