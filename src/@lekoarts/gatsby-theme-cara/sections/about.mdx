## About

#### Some Text

After graduating in 2020 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree (First Class Honours) in Software Engineering,
 I am working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as part
  of a team in various companies across world. I acquired project and time
   management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively
    meeting milestones and deadlines.

As a freelance web developer and designer I collaborated with several graphic designers in Pakistan, USA 
and Nigeria, at the same time maintaining clients world wide.

I have worked on a multitude of web and print based projects for a range of clients providing Web
 Design (Photoshop, AdobeXd, JustInMind,) , Prototying (Balsamiq, )and Development (HTML, CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery, React.js, Bootstrap, MaterialUI, Firebase, Commerce.js, Stripe),
  eCommerce Solutions, Corporate Branding and Graphic Design.
   During my Engineering degree I studied Information Architecture, and therefore have a keen understanding
    of wireframes, sitemaps and user experience design which I put to good use on every project I work
     on.

I am currently working in Siemens between Pakistan, Germany and Italy. I am always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype. These days I enjoy spending my free time riding my bike, baking and crocheting and learning new skills as well.
